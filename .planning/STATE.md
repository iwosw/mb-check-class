# Project State

- Current focus: Phase 06 player-cycle GameTest validation is active; Plan 01 is complete, and the immediate next goal is to extend the new helper/slice baseline into settlement labor, upkeep flow, and the stitched full player cycle without deep production rewrites.
- Runtime base: `recruits`
- Active runtime mod: `bannermod`
- Workers status: absorbed into the active root runtime as a subsystem; registry-layer ids now publish under `bannermod` while legacy source/resources remain preserved under `workers/`
- Pending major work: Phase 06 player-cycle GameTest validation for shared player ownership, settlement labor participation, live supply-to-upkeep transitions, and one stitched authority-safe gameplay loop, plus any remaining non-critical/custom payload compatibility follow-up and optional deeper source-tree cleanup
- Primary references: `MERGE_PLAN.md`, `MERGE_NOTES.md`, `.planning/CODEBASE.md`, `.planning/VERIFICATION.md`
- Phase 06 planning artifacts: `.planning/phases/06-player-cycle-gametest-validation/`
- Phase 01 planning artifacts: `.planning/phases/01-workspace-bootstrap/`
- Latest execution summary: `.planning/phases/06-player-cycle-gametest-validation/06-player-cycle-gametest-validation-01-SUMMARY.md`

## Decisions

- Phase 01 plan 01 keeps the repository anchored to one root Gradle project named `bannermod`.
- `.planning/` is the only active planning root; `.planning_legacy_recruits/` and `.planning_legacy_workers/` remain archive-only context.
- [Phase 01-workspace-bootstrap]: Keep the default bootstrap validation baseline at compileJava, processResources, and test until root GameTests become meaningful.
- [Phase 01-workspace-bootstrap]: Use MERGE_NOTES.md as the active log whenever legacy wording or archived plans disagree with root code and docs.
- [Phase 02-runtime-unification-design]: BannerMod remains the only active public runtime identity for the merged mod.
- [Phase 02-runtime-unification-design]: Workers-owned GUI, structure, and language assets now have an explicit bannermod namespace end-state.
- [Phase 02-runtime-unification-design]: The merged runtime only guarantees known Workers-era migration seams, not standalone workers mod compatibility.
- [Phase 02-runtime-unification-design]: BannerMod-owned config is the target end-state, while Workers config registration remains transitional only.
- [Phase 03-workers-subsystem-absorption]: Workers is treated as an absorbed in-process subsystem behind the merged BannerMod runtime rather than a separate live mod boundary.
- [Phase 04-resource-and-data-consolidation]: Active merged resources, pack wiring, and registry-coupled namespaces are already consolidated under `bannermod`; preserved `workers` assets remain migration or cleanup-only baggage.
- [Phase 05-stabilization-and-cleanup]: Retained Workers JUnit suites run through the root test source set instead of a separate Workers-only entrypoint.
- [Phase 05-stabilization-and-cleanup]: Build-area mutation is guarded by the shared work-area authoring rule boundary before server-side updates run.
- [Phase 05-stabilization-and-cleanup]: Legacy recruits and workers update-check listeners stay disabled until one merged release-feed contract exists.
- [Slice follow-up]: Shared planning vocabulary for strategic, settlement, military, civilian, and logistics layers lives in `.planning/codebase/INTEGRATED_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `.planning/CODEBASE.md`.
- [Slice follow-up]: Root smoke coverage now asserts the recruit-owned `bannermod` runtime identity and the worker subsystem network offset in one merged-runtime regression test.
- [Slice follow-up]: Shared owner, same-team, admin, and forbidden authority vocabulary now lives in `src/main/java/com/talhanation/bannermod/authority/BannerModAuthorityRules.java` and backs both worker authoring rules and worker-control recovery.
- [Slice follow-up]: Shared supply-status vocabulary now lives in `src/main/java/com/talhanation/bannermod/logistics/BannerModSupplyStatus.java` and exposes build-project material pressure, worker storage blockage, and recruit upkeep food/payment pressure without changing current AI behavior.
- [Slice follow-up]: Shared config-file taxonomy now lives in `src/main/java/com/talhanation/bannermod/config/BannerModConfigFiles.java`, and the merged bootstrap resolves `bannermod-military.toml`, `bannermod-settlement.toml`, and `bannermod-client.toml` with explicit low-risk migration from `bannermod-server.toml` and `workers-server.toml`.
- [Slice follow-up]: Root `gametest` is no longer empty; `src/gametest/java/com/talhanation/bannermod/IntegratedRuntimeGameTests.java` now proves merged runtime coexistence and one live recruit-worker-crop-area interaction inside one BannerMod GameTest runtime.
- [Slice follow-up]: Root integrated gameplay validation now spawns a recruit, a farmer worker, and a crop area in one live BannerMod GameTest to prove shared-owner recruit friendly-fire protection, worker work-area authorization, and worker control recovery across the merged runtime seam.
- [Slice follow-up]: Root integrated supply validation now also spawns a recruit and an owned build area in one live BannerMod GameTest to prove settlement build-material pressure and a recruit upkeep transition from blocked to ready project through the same shared `BannerModSupplyStatus` seam.
- [Slice follow-up]: `./gradlew verifyGameTestStage` is currently green with 26 required tests after adding the live settlement-to-military supply GameTest.
- [Phase 06-player-cycle-gametest-validation]: The next roadmap phase extends root GameTests from isolated merged-runtime seams into player-facing cycle validation for shared ownership, settlement labor, upkeep supply, and one stitched authority-safe gameplay loop.
- [Phase 06-player-cycle-gametest-validation]: Keep IntegratedRuntimeGameTests limited to merged runtime seam smoke coverage.
- [Phase 06-player-cycle-gametest-validation]: Move ownership assertions into a dedicated BannerModOwnershipCycleGameTests artifact so later Phase 06 slices can grow independently.
